# cvu-learning-materials
Non comprehensive list of learning materials that I used during my time at CVU

## Programming with Python
- [CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa19/) : A really good introduction to programming methodology that formed much of the foundation for the rest of my programming journey
- [Beyond the basic stuff with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter0.html) : Helped me with writing more pythonic code

## Software Engineering
- [Materials from NUS CS2103T Software Engineering](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/index.html) : Introducted me to better coding practices, and more importantly, unit testing and integrated testing.
- [Docker Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTFZFxd4hOI) : Learnt the basics of docker here

## Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- [Neural Network Playlist by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) : Really useful in helping me to build my initial intuition on Neural Networks and machine learning theory
- [Deep Learning Fundementals - Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xq7LwI2y8_QtvuXZedL6tQU) : Helped me to gain a broad overview of deep learning and how to train a model!
- [Hands On Computer Vision with TensorFlow 2](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Computer-Vision-with-TensorFlow-2) : At a time when we were using more TF2, this read helped me to learn tremendously about the history of computer vision models. I learnt about the major architectures introduced by the top submissions in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) such as VGG, Inception, ResNet, Yolo, R-CNN etc.
- [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xflCLdJh0n0&list=PLpFsSf5Dm-pd5d3rjNtIXUHT-v7bdaEIe&index=4) : This course really helped to introduce me to a lot more structure and strategy to training, validating and testing models
- [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) : The repository that I used for most of my time here.

## Object Tracking
- Change Point Detection
  - [How to use Background Subtraction Models](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d1/dc5/tutorial_background_subtraction.html)
- Kalman Filter
  - [Kalman Filter Tutorial](https://www.kalmanfilter.net/default.aspx) : Helped me in understanding how the Kalman filter worked
  - [Documentation for OpenCV's Kalman Filter Class](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dd/d6a/classcv_1_1KalmanFilter.html)
- [DeepSort Repo](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort)

## Concurrency / Parallelism
Read up a bit on this to try to speed up video analytics processes
- [Multi-Threading in Python](https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/)
- [Multi-Processing in Python](https://superfastpython.com/multiprocessing-in-python/)
- [Speeding up video reading with multi-threading](https://sihabsahariar.medium.com/a-multi-threading-approach-for-faster-opencv-video-streaming-in-python-7324f11dbd2f)
- [Parallelism for Computer Vision](https://towardsdatascience.com/speedy-cv-pipelines-using-parallelism-d7bebad2ff5f)
